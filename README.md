Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
==========================

MLB sentiment analysis via Twitter

In this analysis, I have scraped Twitter data for all 30 major league baseball teams and have given the tweet a positve or negative rating based off of Hu & Liu’s opinion lexicon. For example, a tweet with 5 positve words and 3 negative words will be given a sentiment score of +2. Each team is searched for in Twitter by using the team's official hashtag followed by the team name. Teams with common names or with the same name as a team from another sport were included with the addition of the word ‘mlb’. For this analysis, 1,500 tweets were scraped for each team.
